I have recently created an interactive To-Do List application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project helped me deepen my experience in DOM manipulation and local data storage with localStorage for data persistence.

Features 🛠️ :

✅ Add, edit, and delete tasks

✅ Mark tasks as completed

✅ Automatic saving in the browser

✅ Intuitive and simple user interface

This small project is a demonstration of the power of JavaScript to create functional and responsive web applications.
